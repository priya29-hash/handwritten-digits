CNNs are a class of deep neural networks specifically designed for processing structured grid data, such as images. They are inspired by the visual cortex's organization and are particularly effective in capturing spatial hierarchies in images. A typical CNN architecture consists of several key components:

Convolutional Layers: These layers apply convolutional filters to the input image, detecting local patterns such as edges, textures, and shapes.

Activation Functions: Functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns.

Pooling Layers: Max pooling operations reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, decreasing computational load and mitigating overfitting.

Fully Connected Layers: After flattening the pooled feature maps, these layers perform classification based on the learned features.
